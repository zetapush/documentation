Once published, everything runs in the ZetaPush Cloud. However the behavior is the same.
Every interaction between the front and _custom cloud services_ goes through the ZetaPush Cloud.

The only main difference is that ZetaPush Cloud manages the hosting, the scalability and the
high availability for you.
