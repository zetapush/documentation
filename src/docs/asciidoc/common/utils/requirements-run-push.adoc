To execute or deploy your application you need to use the _Command Line Interface (CLI)_.

You can check if you already installed the CLI with: 

[source, console]
----
$ zeta --version
----

If the CLI returns a result as `0.18.4`, the CLI is installed.

Otherwise, you can install it with:

[source, console]
----
$ npm install -g @zetapush/cli
----
