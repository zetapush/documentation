You can generate a classic application with the following command:

.Generate application
[source, console]
----
$ npm init @zetapush myApp <1>
----
<1> _myApp_ is the name of the folder that will be created with all the generated files

This command can takes several parameters: 

* *--developer-login*: Define which developer login (ZetaPush account) to use
* *--developer-password*: Define which developer password (ZetaPush account) to use
* *--appName*: Define which application (defined in your ZetaPush account) to use

This will generate a tree structure of a classic application:

include::{docdir}/common/code/generated-tree-init.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::{docdir}/common/code/table-definition-generated-files.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

TODO: ailleurs
All dependencies are already installed, so you can run your application locally or deploy it. npm scripts are also configured in the `package.json` file.

So you can use either the _CLI_ using the commands: 

- `zeta run` to start your custom cloud services locally
- `zeta push` to upload your code on ZetaPush cloud and let ZetaPush publish your application

Or run commands through npm:

- `npm run start` to start your custom cloud services locally
- `npm run deploy` to upload your code on ZetaPush cloud and let ZetaPush publish your application
