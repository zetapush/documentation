You can use an IDE for speeding up your development:

* https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code^]
* https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm^]
* https://atom.io/[Atom^]
* ...

Thanks to typing provided by TypeScript, these IDE can provide accurate auto-completion when
you develop your _custom cloud services_. 

That's why auto-completion also works with ZetaPush _built-in cloud services_:

.Auto-completion on _cloud functions_

.Auto-completion on _cloud functions_ parameters
image::{images-dir}/auto-completion/parameters.png[role=center]

.Auto-completion on _cloud functions_ return value
image::{images-dir}/auto-completion/returned-values.png[role=center]


As you can see, in addition to auto-completion, documentation of _cloud services_ is
also available.
