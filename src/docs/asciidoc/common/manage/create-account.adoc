Currently, the only way to get a ZetaPush account is by contacting us. The aim is to understand your needs
and to advise you even if you just want to test it:

* link:{free-trial-url}[Signup for a free trial]
* link:{contact-url}[Contact us for more suitable account]

Your account will be created soon after the first contact and an application that fits your
needs will be available. Then you are ready to start working with ZetaPush.

[NOTE]
====
Soon we will open access to everyone for free trial. Account creation will be available through
our CLI tool, from the main site and the web console.
