== worker

By convention, the directory `worker` contains the back code (algorithms, business logic, ...). For example you can have this tree structure:

```console
└── worker
    └── index.ts    // <1>
```
<1> The file that contains the declaration of the custom cloud service

There is one main file by worker. By default, this is index.ts but you can change this in the `package.json` file (property `main`).

Here is the most simple sample to show how to declare a custom cloud service:
