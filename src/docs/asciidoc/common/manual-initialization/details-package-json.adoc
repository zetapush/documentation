== package.json

The `package.json` is the most important file in the application. It contains all the information needed to deploy or run your application on the ZetaPush platform.

[NOTE]
====
The credentials of the ZetaPush account are in the `.zetarc` and not in `package.json` to avoid leaking sensitive information.
====

The minimal `package.json` is below:
