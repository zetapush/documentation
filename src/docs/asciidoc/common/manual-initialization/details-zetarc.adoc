== .zetarc

To specify which account (on the ZetaPush platform) you use for an application, you fill the file `.zetarc` with the account information.

This file is in **JSON** format. The minimal properties are:

- _developerLogin_: Login of the developer account on the ZetaPush platform
- _developerPassword_: Password of the developer account on the ZetaPush platform
- _appName_: The name of your application

TIP: If you want to create a new application, you can leave the _appName_ property empty, this will create a new application and fill your _.zetarc_ when you will run or deploy your code.
