When you some _cloud functions_, you can use inside them the context. There are 2 useful features with this context:

* Use the logger associated with the context
* Know the *caller* of this _cloud function_

.How to use the context

The context is a dependency that is provided by the ZetaPush Cloud. So you need to use the dependency injection to get it. (link:#dependency-injection[See more details about dependency injection])

include::{docdir}/common/code/worker-use-request-context.adoc[]

NOTE: The context injected by the _ZetaPush Cloud_ is injected in the property named `requestContext`. You need to use this name for use this context.

In the above example, we use the `owner` property. This is the unique technical ID to identify a user on the _ZetaPush Cloud_. This is the same ID that is used in the _built-in cloud services_ named `userKey`.
