export default class Api {                                    // <1>
  /**
   * Get an Hello World string with server side timestamp value
   */
  hello() {                                                   // <2>

  }
}
----
<1> You export a `class` with the name you want.
<2> You define a custom cloud function just by writing a normal function. This example has no parameters but you could have any parameters you want.
<3> You can write any code you want and return a value (or not). 
In this sample, the function is synchronous but you could also return a link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[Promise]
or even use link:https://javascript.info/async-await[async/await syntax].

[TIP]
====
`export` is the standard way to make anything importable in an other file in TypeScript. You need to export your class so ZetaPush can import it and instantiate it.
