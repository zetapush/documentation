== What it does ?

The generated project is really simple. It is just a web page that uses some JavaScript to call a cloud function named `hello` when button is clicked.
The cloud function is a custom cloud function that simply returns a message with the current date.
The result is retrieved by the JavaScript code and displayed in the browser console (using `console.log`).

== Structure of generated project

The files of the generated project are structured as followed:

include::{docdir}/common/code/generated-tree-init.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
