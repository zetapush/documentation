_ZetaPush_ provides the scalability of yours workers.

For example, if you have deployed an application on the _ZetaPush cloud_,
it is possible to increase the number of worker to scale the application.

[NOTE]
====
For now, to scale your application, you need to link:{contact-url}[contact us]. 
But in the next versions, the scalability will be automatic.

Another feature that will be available in the next versions is the possibility to scale up your application
on a short period to absorb peak loads without extra cost.
