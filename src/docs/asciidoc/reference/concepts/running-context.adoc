When you develop your _cloud services_, you can use the current context.
The most important thing about the context is that *is not the same* during the development phase,
when you launch your worker with `zeta run`, and when the worker is deployed with `zeta push`.

To handle this, ZetaPush provides some util functions to get the current context.
There are 3 classes to manage the context :

* <<reference#context-environment, Environment>>
* <<reference#configuration-properties, ConfigurationProperties>>
* <<reference#zetapush-context, ZetaPushContext>>
