When you develop your _cloud services_, you may want to use the current context.
The most important thing about this is that it depends of your runtime environment.
Indeed, the properties will be not the same when your worker is running locally
or when your worker is running on the _ZetaPush cloud_.

.Different contexts
[TIP]
=====
The context is not the same between locally and in the _ZetaPush cloud_ because in the first
case the context is provided by the <<reference#cli, CLI>> and in the second case the context is provided
by the _ZetaPush platform_. 
=====

To handle this, ZetaPush provides some util functions to get the current context.
There are 3 classes to manage the context :

* <<reference#context_environment, Environment>>
* <<reference#configuration_properties, ConfigurationProperties>>
* <<reference#zetapush_context, ZetaPushContext>>
