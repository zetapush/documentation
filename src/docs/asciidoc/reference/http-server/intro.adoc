ZetaPush provides you the possibility to add a _HTTP server_ in your application to handle _HTTP_ requests.
A _HTTP server_ is already used in one _Cloud Service_, the _Standard User Workflow_ (To handle confirmation account registration for example).

You have two possibilities:

* <<reference#internal_http_server, Use the provided HTTP server>>
* <<reference#custom_http_server, Create your own HTTP server>>
