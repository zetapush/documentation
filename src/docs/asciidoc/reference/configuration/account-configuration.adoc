To use `ZetaPush`, you need to have an account and an application.
If you don't have any of them, you can link:{free-trial-url}[signup for a free trial] or link:{contact-url}[contact us for more suitable account].

Then, you can set your account configuration in the `.zetarc` file.
It is at the root of your application.

Here is the list of properties that can be used. For each of them, you also have the associated <<reference#cli, cli flag>> and environment variable.
