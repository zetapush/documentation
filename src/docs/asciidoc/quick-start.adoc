=== Generated project

.Result of {appName} project
image::{images-dir}/hello-world/result.png[role=center]

The generated project:

- Provides a web page (front part)
- The web page automatically connects to ZetaPush Cloud.
+
TIP: The connection is requested with `client.connect()` in `{appName}/front/index.html`
- The web page displays a button named `hello()`.
+
TIP: See `{appName}/front/index.html`
- Provides a custom cloud service that generates a message ("hello world from JavaScript" followed by the date as a timestamp).
+
TIP: The executed code is available in `{appName}/worker/index.ts`
- When the `hello()` button is clicked, the custom cloud service is called and the response is displayed in the browser console. The text of the button is also updated with the count of custom cloud services responses.
+
TIP: See call to `api.hello()` in `{appName}/front/index.js`.

== Run locally your first project

=== From your terminal

include::{docdir}/common/cli/run-project.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

This command launches both a local web server on `localhost:3000` and the custom cloud services.
You can open a web browser on `localhost:3000` and open the browser console.

You can click on the button and see the result of the custom cloud service call in the browser console.

=== How it works

== Push your first project in the Cloud

=== From your terminal

include::{docdir}/common/cli/push-project.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

This command uploads your code (front and worker) to the ZetaPush cloud. ZetaPush then handles the deployment
by publishing your front and your custom cloud services.

The CLI displays the URL to access the published web page.

=== How it works

== What's next

You have created a new application, executed it locally and then published it.

Now, you are ready to code your own application:

- See <<developer-manual.adoc#_develop_your_front_with_zetapush, how to use built-in ZetaPush cloud services>>
- See <<developer-manual.adoc#_develop_your_business_logic, how to develop your custom cloud services>>
